### Thesis for a Master's degree in Operations Management

For testing, we used the Instacart basket analysis dataset. It can be found in [Kaggle][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis]. A folder named "data_raw/instacart" must be created in the root directory, and the files required are "aisles.csv", "departments.csv", "order_products__prior.csv", "order_products__train.csv", "orders.csv" and "products.csv".

The file "instacart_preprocessing.ipynb" is used to do a small EDA and to generate the samples for model testing.
